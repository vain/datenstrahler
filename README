NAME
       datenstrahler - display a web site

SYNOPSIS
       datenstrahler [-c class] [-f] [-g geometry] [-i name] [-z zoom] uri

DESCRIPTION
       This  program displays a web site. It's meant to be used in “information radia‐
       tors” or similar applications: You create a simple web site that displays  some
       useful  information  and  then you use datenstrahler on a small computer with a
       large screen to display that web site.

       A few hints:

       ·   If you want to hide scroll bars, you must do this in the CSS code  of  your
           web site.

       ·   If you want to display live data, your web site will most likely need to be
           reloaded periodically. Your web site must do this by itself,  using  common
           HTML  or JavaScript methods. datenstrahler does not reload the web site for
           you.

       ·   You should refrain from using  iframes.  datenstrahler  will  automatically
           reload  the  web  site  if there's a loading error (e.g., disconnected from
           network), but it won't detect these kinds of errors in iframes.

OPTIONS
       -c class, -i name
              Set the “WM_CLASS” property of the X11 window. Defaults to Datenstrahler
              as class and datenstrahler as name.

       -f     Start up in fullscreen mode. Turned off by default.

       -g geometry
              Apply the X11 geometry string geometry to the window.

       -z zoom
              Zoom the web page. zoom defaults to 1.0.

       You can customize datenstrahler further by editing the file config.h and recom‐
       piling the source code.

HISTORY
       datenstrahler was originally written by Peter Hofmann. The project was  started
       in August 2015.

       datenstrahler  is  a  stripped  down version of lariza(1).  Furthermore, daten‐
       strahler is meant to replace wepsyte: A small Python script  which  served  the
       same purpose, but which was using the old and now deprecated WebKit1 API.
